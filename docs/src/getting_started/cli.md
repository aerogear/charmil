# Getting started with the Charmil CLI

Charmil offers its own command-line interface (CLI) that allows developers to construct their new Charmil project with additional support for other templates, allowing them to focus on more essential aspects of their project.

- ## Installation:

  The Charmil CLI can be installed by any of the following ways:

  - By downloading the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/releases).

  - By using the `go get` command:

    ```bash
    $ go get github.com/aerogear/charmil/cli/cmd/charmil
    ```

    This will create the Charmil CLI executable under your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

- ## Usage:
  For usage instructions on Charmil CLI, refer to [this link](../charmil_cli.md).
