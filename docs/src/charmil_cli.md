Charmil CLI provides a way to create and manage the Charmil project. CLI gives you preconfigured shell commands as recommended by Charmil, so you don't have to integrate charmil core yourself. Available commands are:

## Init Command

Init command initializes a Charmil project boilerplate(starter). This will generate shell commands, readme, licence, etc to get you started easily.

```bash
$ charmil init
```

Fill in the prompted info(github owner, repository and cli name) to get started!

## Add Command

Add command adds a new command into the CLI

```bash
$ charmil add CMD_NAME
```

## Crud Command

Helps developers generate CRUD commands for their CLI.
